/*JavaScript recognizes seven primitive (immutable) data types: Boolean, Null, Undefined, Number, String, Symbol (new with ES6), and BigInt (new with ES2020), and one type for mutable items: Object. Note that in JavaScript, arrays are technically a type of object.

Add two console.log() statements to check the typeof each of the two variables seven and three in the code.*/

console.log(typeof seven);
console.log(typeof three);
