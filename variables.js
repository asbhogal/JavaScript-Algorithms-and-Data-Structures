/*     Often, you will set data into a variable. A variable allows computers to store and manipulate data in a dynamic fashion, and is basically a label to point to the data. A variable is like a box, and it can be filled with anything/the data you want*/

// A VARIABLE CAN BE SET TO ANY OF THE DATA TYPES SEEN PREVIOUSLY

// THERE ARE THREE WAYS TO DECLARE A VARIABLE IN JS:

    // 1. var

    // THIS CAN BE USED ACROSS THE WHOLE PROGRAM AND CHANGED AT ANY POINT

    var myName = "Aman" //DECLARING THE VARIABLE myName AND ASSIGNING IT A STRING TYPE (WHICH IS COMMON) VALUE OF Aman

    myname = 8          // THE CONTENTS AND TYPE OF VARIABLE myName HERE CAN THEN ALSO BE CHANGED LATER

    // 2. let

    // THIS WILL ONLY BE USED WITHIN THE SCOPE OF WHERE IT WAS DECLARED
    
    let ourName = "freeCodeCamp"

    // 3. const

    // VARIABLE WHICH SHOULD NEVER AND CAN NEVER CHANGE ONCE SET. ATTEMPTING TO CHANGE THIS WILL RETURN AN ERROR

    const pi = 3.14
