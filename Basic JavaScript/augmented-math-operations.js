// COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT WITH AUGMENTED ADDITION

// IT IS COMMON TO ADD NUMBERS TO A VARIABLE, INITIALLY AND DOWN THE LINE:

var a = 3;
var b = 17;
var c = 12;

a = a + 12;
b = 9 + b;
c = c + 7;

console.log(a, b, c); // OUTPUTS 15, 26, 19

// BECAUSE THIS IS SUCH A COMMON PATTERN, THERE'S A SHORTCUT TO ACHIEVE THE SAME THING USING THE += OPERATOR:

a += 12;
b += 9;
c += 7;

console.log(a, b, c); // OUTPUTS 15, 26, 19 (NEGATING THE ABOVE)

// THIS WAY, WE ADD THE VALUE TO THE VARIABLE AND ASSIGN THE ANSWER TO THAT VARIABLE SIMULTANEOUSLY. A SIMILAR APPROACH CAN BE APPLIED TO THE FOLLOWING OPERATIONS...

// COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT WITH AUGMENTED SUBTRACTION

// SIMILAR TO ABOVE, THE -= OPERATOR SUBTRACTS THE VALUE FROM THE VARIABLE AND ASSIGNS THE ANSWER TO IT

var x = 11;
var y = 9;
var z = 3;

x -= 6;
y -= 15;
z -= 1;

console.log(x, y, z); // OUTPUTS 5, -6, 2

// COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT WITH AUGMENTED MULTIPLICATION

var a1 = 5;
var b1 = 12;
var c1 = 4.6;

a1 *= 5;
b1 *= 3;
c1 *= 10;

console.log(a1, b1, c1); //OUTPUTS 25, 36, 46

// COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT WITH AUGMENTED DIVISION

var a2 = 48;
var b2 = 108;
var c2 = 33;

a2 /= 12;
b2 /= 4;
c2 /= 11;

console.log(a2, b2, c2); // OUTPUTS 4, 27, 3
