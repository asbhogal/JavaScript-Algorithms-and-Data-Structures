<h1>JavaScript Algorithms & Data Structures - freeCodeCamp</h1>

</div>

Course notes for the JavaScript course provided by freeCodeCamp entitled 'JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures.' Please note that work on this repository will be handled differently, as previously the repo owner was undertaking this from the YouTube video by freeCodeCamp, however the course content is now available as a Bootcamp via ClassCentral which the repo owner is now enrolled on and undertaking. Notes from activites and exercises will therefore be pushed to this repo to serve as a 'bank' of resources and future reference.
