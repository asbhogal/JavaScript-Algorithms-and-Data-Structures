// All objects in JavaScript (with a few exceptions) have a prototype. Also, an objectâ€™s prototype itself is an object. Because a prototype is an object, a prototype can have its own prototype. Modify the code to show the correct prototype chain.

function Dog(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

let beagle = new Dog("Snoopy");

Dog.prototype.isPrototypeOf(beagle); // yields true

// Fix the code below so that it evaluates to true
Object.prototype.isPrototypeOf(Dog.prototype);
