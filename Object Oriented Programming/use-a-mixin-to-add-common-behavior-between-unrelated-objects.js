// As you have seen, behavior is shared through inheritance. However, there are cases when inheritance is not the best solution. Inheritance does not work well for unrelated objects like Bird and Airplane. They can both fly, but a Bird is not a type of Airplane and vice versa.

// For unrelated objects, it's better to use mixins. A mixin allows other objects to use a collection of functions.

// Create a mixin named glideMixin that defines a method named glide. Then use the glideMixin to give both bird and boat the ability to glide.

let bird = {
  name: "Donald",
  numLegs: 2
};

let boat = {
  name: "Warrior",
  type: "race-boat"
};

// Only change code below this line

let glideMixin = function(obj) {
  obj.glide = function() {
    console.log("Glide baby, glide!")
  }
};

glideMixin(bird);
glideMixin(boat);

bird.glide();
boat.glide();
